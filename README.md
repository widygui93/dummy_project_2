This repo for implement basic OOP in php

# **_about_**
In this web app, I try to implement what I learn OOP including initiate an object, create class, extend class, initiate property and method. I also learn validate when user register and login by regex. I try to create responsive design with mobile-first in mind. And I try to use composer to learn how to use third-party library.

For front end, you can register and login. You can add menu in cart, view what menu in cart, edit and delete menu as well. You can pay by upload your receipt(still dummy). You can see your history transaction and detail as well. You can edit your profile pic, data, and change password too. 

For back end, admin can add, edit, delete and view menu type and menu. There are report for user and transactions as well. Admin can search for user and date of transaction to view its detail and receipt.
